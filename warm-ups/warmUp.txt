// -------------------Write one paragraph about your ideal web development job.-------------------

/* I think id rather work in person than remote. but only in an office with a good culture and lots of breaks and colors.
I'd like the opportunity to engage in projects with creative freedom.
I want to get paid more than enough for the tasks im assigned.
I'd also like to have enough hours away from work that id be able to pursue passion projects outside of coding.
I want it to be a positive learning environment where everyone is trying their best to improve and develop greater proficiency.

In Summary:         CREATIVE FREEDOM
                    IN PERSON
                    COLORFUL, COMFORTABLE AND WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT
                    HIGH COMPENSATION
                    BREAKS, TIME OFF, AND VACATION
                    LEARNING ENCOURAGED
